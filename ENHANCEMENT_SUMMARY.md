## 🎮 **ENHANCED GAMEPLAY EXPERIENCE**

### **🌟 Rich Narrative Gameplay**
```bash
# Before: Dry system messages
"You move north to Forest Clearing. You take 5 damage. You gain 50 experience."

# After: Immersive AI narrative
"Your footsteps crunch on fallen leaves as you emerge into a moonlit clearing. 
Ancient oak trees tower overhead, their branches whispering secrets in the wind. 
A fierce battle tests your resolve, but your blade finds its mark. Victory 
surges through your veins as you stand triumphant, wiser from the encounter."

Suggestions: ["Explore the ancient oak", "Search for hidden treasures"]
```

### **🎒 Advanced Item System**
```bash
# Complete inventory management
curl -X GET http://localhost:3005/inventory \
  -H "x-user-id: user123"

# Use consumable items
curl -X POST http://localhost:3005/inventory/use \
  -H "x-user-id: user123" \
  -d '{"itemInstanceId":"potion_001","quantity":1}'

# Equip weapons and armor
curl -X POST http://localhost:3005/inventory/equip \
